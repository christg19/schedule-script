This project is an automated script designed to efficiently schedule daily meetings based on the working hours of employees throughout the week. The script inputs the work schedules for each employee on the weekdays and analyzes their free slots. Using this information, the script identifies available time intervals where at least three workers are free and generates meeting sections optimized for their schedules. This process ensures that meetings are scheduled efficiently, minimizing conflicts and making the best use of the employees' available time.
